Bibasilar atelectasis evident.  Again lung parenchyma evaluation is\\n limited by respiratory motion with blurring, particularly in the right lung\\n base.  No gross consolidation is evident.  No significant superimposed edema\\n is noted.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.\\n\\n IMPRESSION:  PICC line tip difficult to confidently assess.  As best can be\\n determined, the distal tip appears to lie within the superior vena cava,\\n approximately 1-2 cm from the superior cavoatrial junction.

There is a mildly heterogeneous echo\\n pattern but no focal masses are seen to suggest metastases.  A large right\\n pleural effusion is noted, but there is no evidence for ascites.  The pancreas\\n is normal in appearance as is the retroperitoneum without evidence of\\n lymphadenopathy.

The spleen is not enlarged.\\n\\n Both kidneys are normal in size measuring approximately 13 cm in length on the\\n left and 10.1 cm on the right.  The left renal length is probably\\n overestimated due to the presence of a large 6.9 x 7.1 x 6.4 cm cyst in the\\n upper pole with thin septation contained inside.  There is also a smaller 3.6\\n x 4.2 x 3.3 cm cyst in the left kidney contiguous to the larger upper pole\\n cyst.

A small degree of\\n hydrocephalus remains, but has increased compared with prior.  Increased FLAIR\\n signal surrounding the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles\\n is likely related to residual transependymal CSF flow.

A preprocedure timeout was performed.\\n Using ultrasonographic guidance and after injection of approximately 5 cc of\\n 1% lidocaine, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a 21-gauge\\n needle.

The edema extends up to the cortical\\n margin of the frontal lobes anteriorly, and there is poor delineation of the\\n [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter junction of the superior medial frontal lobes.  Areas of\\n increased diffusion signal are noted along the superoanterior left frontal\\n lobe and medial right frontal lobe, (at the level of the lateral ventricles).\\n There may be a component of cortical edema and infarction contributing to the\\n signal abnormalities observed in these locations.
