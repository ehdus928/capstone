PyTorch: setting up devices
The default value for the training argument `--report_to` will change in v5 (from all installed integrations to none). In v5, you will need to use `--report_to all` to get the same behavior as now. You should start updating your code and make this info disappear :-).
The following columns in the training set  don't have a corresponding argument in `BertForSequenceClassification.forward` and have been ignored: inform, readmission, Unnamed: 0.
***** Running training *****
  Num examples = 1000
  Num Epochs = 5
  Instantaneous batch size per device = 16
  Total train batch size (w. parallel, distributed & accumulation) = 16
  Gradient Accumulation steps = 1
  Total optimization steps = 315
